  def caveats; <<~EOS.undent
    Gopass has been installed, have fun!
    If upgrading from `pass`, everything should work as expected.
    If installing from scratch, you need to either initialize a new repository now...
      gopass init
    ...or clone one from a source:
      gopass clone git@code.example.com:example/pass.git
    In order to use the great autocompletion features (they're helpful with gopass),
    please make sure you have autocompletion for homebrew enabled:
